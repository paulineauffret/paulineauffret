## Hi there !

### I'm a bioinformatician (MSc) 💻 specializing in NGS data analysis 🧬 and pipeline implementation 🔧

Currently, my main interests are **building [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) bioinformatics pipelines** using **[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)** and setting up **FAIR tools** to make **reproducible reasearch work**.   
        
My main fields of expertise are :
- **FAIR data** 
- **RNA-seq** and **ChIP-seq** data analysis
-  **Nextflow** and **R/Python/Bash** programming
-  **Testing** and **benchmarking tools** 
- **Helping people** with their bionformatics analyses  and **debugging code!**   

What I love in my job is that I am learning every day !   
     
I'm looking forward to **using my skills** to **help the research community** and learning about **machine learning**, **long reads** and **single cell** analysis.
